# Assignment-5
Task 1:

Student Marks Lookup
This is a simple Python program that helps you check a student's marks.  
You enter the student's name, and the program will display their marks if the name exists in the list.  
If the name is not found, it will show "Student not found".
1. The program stores student names and marks in a dictionary:
   - Alice → 85  
   - Bob → 78  
   - Charlie → 92  
   - Diana → 88  
   - Ethan → 76  

2. When you run the program, it asks:  
   **`Enter the student's name:`**

3. If the name is in the dictionary, it prints:  
   **`Alice's marks: 85`**

4. If the name is not in the dictionary, it prints:  
   **`Student not found`**

Task 2:

List Operations in Python
This program demonstrates basic list operations in Python:
- Creating a list of numbers.
- Extracting a portion of the list.
- Reversing the extracted portion.
- Printing the results.

1. A list of numbers from 1 to 10 is created using `range(1, 11)`.
2. The first five elements are extracted using slicing (`numbers[:5]`).
3. The extracted list is reversed using slicing with a step of -1 (`[::-1]`).
4. The program prints:
   - The original list.
   - The extracted first five elements.
   - The reversed extracted elements.
